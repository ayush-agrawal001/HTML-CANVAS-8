# HTML-CANVAS-8
This project showcases a dynamic canvas animation where colorful circles orbit around the mouse pointer. The circles move in smooth, random patterns, creating an engaging and visually appealing effect. The animation is implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## How It Works

The animation consists of the following key components:

1. **Canvas Setup**: The canvas element is dynamically sized to match the window dimensions. This ensures that the animation covers the entire viewport.

2. **Circle Generation**: Circles are randomly generated with various colors and initial positions. Each circle is represented as an object with properties such as position, radius, color, and velocity.

3. **Mouse Interaction**: The animation responds to mouse movements by updating the position of the circles relative to the mouse pointer. As the mouse moves, the circles orbit around it, creating an interactive effect.

4. **Smooth Animation**: The animation loop continuously updates the position of the circles and redraws them on the canvas. This results in smooth, fluid movement of the circles across the screen.
